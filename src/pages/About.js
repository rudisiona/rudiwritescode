        <h1>Rudi the Coder</h1>
        <p>In 2024, I completed my community college experience at Los Angeles Harbor College.
            After earning my Associate's Degree in Math and Natural Sciences, and Social and 
            Behaioral Sciences; and my Assoicate's to Transfer in Journalism, and eager to 
            enter the work field, I decided to pivot my education. In 2025, I started and successfully
            completed General Assembly's Part Time Software Engineering Bootcamp while working
            as an Office Administrative Assistant. Upon finishing the program, I coninure
            working and coding regularly on projects shown in my projects tab.
